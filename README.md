### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sophie. I am an award winning MChem graduate, graduating from the University of Bath with a 2.1 masters in chemistry with a study year abroad :lab_coat:. My final year project, a synthetic and computational study of Bismuth as a potential enabler of sustainable chemical processes, won a course-wide prize for the best final year inorganic project :recycle:. 

I am currently studying with the Digital Futures Academy on the Software Engineering course. I am a competitive and hardworking person and in my spare time, I enjoy playing a variety of sports at a competitive level :woman_playing_handball:. I aim to become more involved with schemes that aim to promote and overcome LGBTQIA+ issues :rainbow_flag:
